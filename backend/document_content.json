This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of urinary \nleukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) in childhood asthma.\nMETHODS: Sixty children with acute asthma were randomly divided into montelukast \n(leukotriene receptor antagonist) treatment and conventional treatment groups (n \n= 30 each). Urinary LTE(4) levels were measured using ELISA and the airway \nresistance Rint was assessed by the lung function instrument at the acute and \nthe convalescence phases. Twenty healthy children were used as the control \ngroup.\nRESULTS: Urinary LTE(4) levels in asthmatic children at the acute and the \nconvalescence phases were significantly higher than those in the control group \n(p<0.01). The urinary LTE(4) levels at the convalescence phase were \nsignificantly reduced compared with those at the acute phase in asthmatic \nchildren (p<0.01). More significantly decreased urinary LTE(4) levels were noted \nin the montelukast treatment group than the conventional treatment group at the \nconvalescence phase (p<0.01). In the acute phase, there was no correlation \nbetween urinary LTE4 level and Rint in asthmatic children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Urinary LTE(4) level is significantly increased in children with \nacute asthma. Urinary LTE(4) is a useful marker for the diagnosis of asthma and \ncan be as a predictor of asthma control and marker of susceptibility to \ntreatment with leukotriene receptor antagonists.",

Animals were also treated with GGTI-2133 (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) once a day \nbefore and during the antigen inhalation period. Repeated antigen inhalation \ncaused an infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, into \nairways. Significant increases in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, eotaxin, thymus and \nactivation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluids and total and OA-specific IgE in sera were also \nfound in the antigen-exposed animals. The systemic treatments with GGTI-2133 \ninhibited the antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into airways almost \ncompletely.

However, \ndata have been accumulating through the years indicating that NSAIDs also act on \nother targets in cell signaling. It has been established that NSAIDs induce \nanti-inflammatory effects independent of COX. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nother inhibitors of COX induce severe bronchospasms and asthmatic attacks in a \nsignificant population of asthmatic patients. The etiology of ASA induced asthma \nis complex and not fully understood, but most evidence points towards an \nabnormality of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Since doses of ASA necessary to \ntreat chronic inflammatory diseases appeared much higher than those required to \ninhibit PG synthesis, COX-independent mechanisms of NSAIDs were postulated. \nRecently, we have shown that NSAIDs induced expression of heat shock proteins \nspecially HSP70. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are normal intracellular proteins \nthat are produced in greater amounts when cells are subjected to stress or \ninjury. Interestingly, a potential pathogenic role for heat shock proteins in \ndiseases such as autoimmune disease, vascular disease has been reported. Because \nmast cells have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of ASA induced \nasthma, a link between heat shock proteins and this disease could postulated.

However, the relationship \nbetween asthma severity or eosinophilic inflammation and the concentrations of \nmediators in sputum is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess sputum PGE(2), cysLT, 8-isoprostane and nitrate \nconcentrations, as well as urinary leukotriene (LT)E(4) and \n9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin (PG)F(2) concentrations, in patients with differing \nseverities of asthma and eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic airway inflammation.\nMETHODS: Inflammatory cells in sputum were assessed in 12 patients with mild, 14 \nwith moderate and 12 with severe persistent asthma, as well as in 13 control \nsubjects. Asthmatic patients were categorized into those with eosinophilic or \nnon-eosinophilic airway inflammation. Sputum PGE(2), cysLT and 8-isoprostane, \nand urinary LTE(4) were extracted on immunoaffinity sorbents, and the \nconcentrations of all mediators were measured using enzyme immunoassays. Sputum \nnitrate concentrations were measured on a chemiluminescence analyzer.\nRESULTS: Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were higher in both moderate (1710 pg/mL) \nand severe asthmatic (1590 pg/mL) compared with control subjects (827 pg/mL) \n(P<0.05). CysLT concentrations were higher in moderate asthmatic compared with \ncontrol or severe asthmatic subjects (P<0.05). Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were \nlower in patients with eosinophilic (1180 pg/mL) compared with non-eosinophilic \nairway inflammation (2520 pg/mL) (P=0.02). In contrast, sputum cysLT and urinary \nLTE(4) concentrations were higher in those with eosinophilic airway inflammation \n(P<0.05). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s was inversely correlated with sputum \neosinophils in all asthmatic patients (r(s)=-0.5, P=0.002). There were no \nsignificant differences in sputum 8-isoprostane or nitrate concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased airway concentrations of PGE(2) are consistent with the \nhypothesis that PGE(2) has a bronchoprotective and anti-inflammatory role in \npatients with more severe asthma. A reduced PGE(2) to cysLT ratio in the airways \nmay adversely affect lung function and contribute to persistence of symptoms and \nairway remodelling in patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

Two previous clinical studies with EFF1009 provided preliminary \nevidence that the medical food improves asthma-related quality of life (ARQOL) \nand asthma management.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact on ARQOL of EFF1009 in adults with asthma.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a randomized, prospective, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in twenty-one (N = 21 \nevaluable) subjects with mild to moderate persistent asthma who consumed the \nmedical food emulsion or placebo emulsion daily for 28 days. All participants \ncontinued their asthma medications throughout the study. ARQOL, including asthma \nsigns and symptoms, and asthma control were measured using the Mini Asthma \nQuality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire \n(ACQ), administered at baseline, Day 14 and Day 28. Safety and tolerability \nparameters, including adverse events, were monitored.\nRESULTS: Baseline ARQOL scores, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) \nand other characteristics were balanced between both groups. Mean (standard \nerror) total MiniAQLQ scores changed by 0.73 (0.38) and -0.22 (0.36) in the \nEFF1009 and placebo groups, respectively, (p < 0.05). The MiniAQLQ symptom \ndomain score was improved in the EFF1009 group (p < 0.05). Total scores for the \nACQ were not significantly improved in either group. Levels of the fatty acid \nEPA in plasma increased in the EFF1009 group but not the placebo group (p < \n0.03). The medical food was well tolerated and no safety concerns were \nidentified.\nCONCLUSIONS: The dietary addition of the medical food EFF1009 to asthma \nmanagement regimens can improve patient perceived, ARQOL and can also improve \nasthma management as evidenced by reduced asthma symptoms.

In a rat ex vivo whole-blood \ncalcium ionophore-induced LTB(4) assay, AM103 (administered orally at 1 mg/kg) \ndisplayed >50% inhibition for up to 6 h with a calculated EC(50) of \napproximately 60 nM.

In this model, the EC(50) \nderived from plasma AM103 was approximately 330 nM for inhibition of both LTB(4) \nand CysLT. In an acute inflammation setting, AM103 displayed dose-dependent \ninhibition of LTB(4), CysLT, and plasma protein extravasation induced by \nperitoneal zymosan injection. In a model of chronic lung inflammation using \novalbumin-primed and challenged BALB/c mice, AM103 reduced the concentrations of \neosinophil peroxidase, CysLTs, and interleukin-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage \nfluid. Finally, AM103 increased survival time in mice exposed to a lethal \nintravenous injection of platelet-activating factor.

Outcome metrics \nincluded the use of short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), the use of oral \ncorticosteroids, inpatient (INP)/emergency department (ED) visits, and \nasthma-related health care costs. A subset of 5000 patients was randomly \nselected for a survey using the Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, the \nWork Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, and the Asthma Therapy \nAssessment Questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Of 56,168 eligible patients, 823 returned completed questionnaires. \nCompared with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), leukotriene modifiers (LMs) were \nassociated with lower odds of INP/ED visits (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; P<.001), \nlower odds of using 6 or more SABA canisters (OR, 0.81; P<.001), and higher \nannual cost ($193; P<.001). In the subgroup analysis of adherent patients, LMs \nwere associated with higher odds of INP/ED visits (OR, 1.74; P=.04), lower odds \nof using 6 or more SABA canisters (OR, 0.46; P<.001), and higher annual cost \n($235; P<.001). Inhaled corticosteroids and LMs had a comparable impact on all \npatient-reported outcomes. For combination therapy, ICS plus a long-acting \nbeta-agonist consistently showed at least equivalent or better outcomes in the \nuse of SABAs and oral corticosteroids, the risk of INP/ED visits, cost, asthma \ncontrol level, quality of life, and impairment in productivity and activity.\nCONCLUSION: Inhaled corticosteroids were associated with a lower risk of INP/ED \nvisits, and a lower cost if adherence was achieved. When adherence cannot be \nachieved, LMs may be a reasonable alternative. Combination therapy with ICS plus \na long-acting beta-agonist was associated with better or equivalent clinical, \neconomic, and patient-reported outcomes.",

The \nsymptom scores and percentage of predicted value of forced expiratory volume in \none second (FEV(1)) (FEV(1)%pred) were measured while the concentrations of \nH(2)O(2), NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-), and cysteinyl-leukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) in induced \nsputum and EBC were detected before and after therapy.\nRESULTS: A total of twenty-five subjects with moderate and severe asthma were \nenrolled. By combined therapy for one month the asthma symptoms relieved and \nFEV(1)%pred improved significantly (P < 0.01). The concentrations of H(2)O(2), \nNO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) and LTE(4) in induced sputum and EBC declined significantly (P \n< 0.01) although the concentrations were still higher than those at normal \nbaseline. More marked reduction of H(2)O(2) and NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) compared to \nLTE(4) was observed. It was revealed that the concentrations of H(2)O(2)and \nNO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) but not of LTE(4) in EBC were negatively correlated with \nFEV(1)%pred (P < 0.01) and positively with symptom scores. Such correlations \nwere also found in H(2)O(2) in induced sputum with FEV(1)%pred and symptom \nscores as well as NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) in induced sputum with FEV(1)%pred. The \nimprovement of FEV(1)%pred after treatment was positively correlated with the \nreduction of H(2)O(2) and NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) both in induced sputum and EBC. \nCorrelation analysis also demonstrated three inflammatory indices were \nequivalent in induced sputum and EBC (correlation coefficient of H(2)O(2), \nNO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) and LTE(4), 0.759, 0.826 and 0.653, respectively.

The level of leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) mRNA in \nPMNL was detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Expression of sPLA(2)s was examined by \nusing RT-PCR. The release of cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) C(4) was measured by \nmeans of enzyme immunoassay.\nRESULTS: Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity was higher in the BALF of \nasthmatic patients than in the control group. BALF PLA(2) activity was blocked \nby the sPLA(2) inhibitors dithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by the cytosolic \nPLA(2) inhibitor AZ-1. HLMCs spontaneously released a PLA(2) activity that was \nincreased on stimulation with anti-IgE. This PLA(2) activity was blocked by \ndithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by AZ-1. HLMCs constitutively express mRNA \nfor group IB, IIA, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA, and XIIB sPLA(2)s. Anti-IgE \ndid not modify the expression of sPLA(2)s. The cell-impermeable inhibitor \nMe-Indoxam significantly reduced (up to 40%) the production of LTC(4) from \nanti-IgE-stimulated HLMCs.\nCONCLUSIONS: sPLA(2) activity is increased in the airways of asthmatic patients. \nHLMCs express multiple sPLA(2)s and release 1 or more of them when activated by \nanti-IgE.

        "abstract": "inflammation in asthma involves their interaction with adhesion molecules \nexpressed on the endothelial cell surface and exposure to inflammatory \nmediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs).\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether interaction of eosinophils with adhesion \nmolecules modifies the functions of these cells induced by cysLTs.\nMETHODS: Eosinophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors, incubated \nin the EIA plates coated with adhesion proteins, and then exposed to LTD4. The \ngeneration of superoxide anion (O2-), adhesion to the plates, and release of \neosinophil-derived neutrotoxin (EDN) were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Neither VCAM-1 nor LTD4 (100 nM) independently induced eosinophil O2- \ngeneration, however, combined exposure to the two molecules synergistically \ninduced eosinophil O2- generation. ICAM-1 by itself induced eosinophil O2- \ngeneration, which was enhanced by LTD4. On the contrary, P-selectin did not \ninduce O2- generation, either in the presence or absence of LTD4. LTD4 \nsignificantly enhanced eosinophil adhesion to rh-VCAM-1 and rh-ICAM-1, but not \nto rh-P-selectin. Finally, we observed that combined exposure of eosinophils to \nLTD4 and VCAM-1 induced the release of EDN.\nCONCLUSION: Combined exposure to VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 and cysLT effectively induces \nthe effector functions of eosinophils. Eosinophil adhesion to and migration \nacross endothelial cells via these specific adhesion proteins and subsequent \nexposure to cysLTs may be mechanisms underlying activation of the effector \nfunctions of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway.",

The cross-sectional relationship between BMI and asthma impairment was \nanalyzed, as was the longitudinal relationship between BMI and response to \nasthma controller therapies.\nRESULTS: One thousand two hundred sixty-five subjects with mild-to-moderate \npersistent asthma were evaluated. Analyses of lean versus overweight/obese \nasthmatic subjects demonstrated small differences in FEV1 (3.05 vs 2.91 L, P = \n.001), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (mean, 83.5% vs 82.4%; P = .01), rescue \nalbuterol use (1.1 vs 1.2 puffs per day, P = .03), and asthma-related quality of \nlife (5.77 vs 5.59, P = .0004). Overweight/obese asthmatic subjects demonstrated \na smaller improvement in exhaled nitric oxide levels with inhaled corticosteroid \n(ICS) treatment than did lean asthmatic subjects (3.6 vs 6.5 ppb, P = .04). With \nICS/long-acting beta-agonist treatment, overweight/obese asthmatic subjects \ndemonstrated smaller improvements in lung function than lean asthmatic subjects, \nwith an 80 mL (P = .04) and 1.7% (P = .02) lesser improvement in FEV1 and \nFEV1/forced vital capacity ratio, respectively. Significant differences in \ntherapeutic response to leukotriene modifiers between BMI categories were not \nobserved.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI is not associated with clinically significant \nworsening of impairment in subjects with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. \nThere is a modest association between increased BMI and reduced therapeutic \neffect of ICS-containing regimens in this patient population.

Cells were \nanalysed for expression of CD63, CD69 and CD203c using flow cytometry. Cell-free \nsupernatants were evaluated for histamine, and LTC4 release and for IL-4 \nsecretion.\nRESULTS: Aspirin-induced expression of CD63, CD69 and CD203c yielded 30%, 80% \nand 70% sensitivity, respectively, but with poor specificity. There was no \nsignificant difference in LTC4 synthesis between groups. None of the patients \nwith AERD (or controls) released IL-4 in response to aspirin.

Aspirin activates some basophils by means of mechanisms \nthat differ from the classical IgE-mediated pathway.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes \n(LTC(4), LTD(4) and, LTE(4)) and the dihydroxy leukotriene LTB(4) are generated \nby a series of enzymes/proteins constituting the LT synthetic pathway or \n5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. Their function is mediated by interacting with \nmultiple receptors. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and LT synthesis \ninhibitors (LTSI) have shown clinical efficacy in asthma and more recently in \nallergic rhinitis. Despite growing knowledge of leukotriene biology, the \nmolecular regulation of these inflammatory mediators remains to be fully \nunderstood. Genes encoding enzymes of the 5-LO pathway (i.e. ALOX5, LTC4S and \nLTA4H) and encoding for LT receptors (CYSLTR1/2 and LTB4R1/2) provide excellent \ncandidates for disease susceptibility and severity; however, their role remains \nunclear. Preliminary data also suggest that 5-LO pathway/receptor gene \npolymorphism can predict patient responses to LTSI and LTRA; however, the exact \nmechanisms require elucidation.

The lowest PEF over the course of one week, expressed as a \npercentage of the highest PEF (Min%Max PEF), was used as an index of fluctuation \nof the airway caliber.

Cysteinyl leucotrienes (CysLT) and \ntransforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) are both increased in asthmatic \nairways and may influence the pathophysiology of disease. However, the \nconsequences of activation of bronchial epithelial cells by these mediators are \nnot fully understood. A proteomic-based approach was used to characterize the \ninflammatory pathways in bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with CysLT \nand TGF-beta(1).\nMETHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were stimulated with 1 ng/mL \nTGF-beta(1) and 50 nmol/L leucotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) for 48 h and whole-cell \nlysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins showing \nstatistically significant differential expression were identified by \nmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and \ndatabase searching.\nRESULTS: Stimulation with LTE(4) increased the expression of three proteins and \nfive proteins showed decreased expression. Of the latter group, two were \ndefinitively identified as heat shock protein (Hsp90 alpha) and stress-70 \nprotein. Hsp90 alpha forms a heterocomplex with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) \nand a significant decrease in GR following LTE(4) stimulation was confirmed. \nTGF-beta(1) downregulated 18 intracellular proteins, including lamin A/C, \nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, protein DJ-1, voltage-dependent \ncalcium channel gamma-7 subunit, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 \nand stress-70 protein.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that by downregulating GR and Hsp90 \nalpha, CysLT may interfere with the action of glucocorticoids.

We also sought to evaluate mast cell activation in anaphylaxis.\nMETHODS: We measured the concentrations of various inflammatory mediators in \nurine samples, which were collected from 32 anaphylactic patients during the \nonset of anaphylaxis and during clinical remission, 21 patients with asthma on \nacute exacerbation and 15 healthy control subjects. Blood and urine specimens \nwere collected from the patients after provocation test. Urinary leukotriene E4 \n(LTE4), 9alpha, 11beta-prostaglandin F2 (9alpha, 11beta-PGF2), \neosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and leukotriene B4 glucuronide (LTBG) \nconcentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay, and the activity of plasma \nplatelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and serum tryptase concentration were \nmeasured using commercially available kits.\nRESULTS: Significantly higher concentrations of urinary LTE4 and 9alpha, \n11beta-PGF2, which immediately decreased during clinical remission, were \nobserved in the anaphylactic patients than in asthmatic patients on acute \nexacerbation and healthy control subjects. Concentrations of EDN and LTBG were \nnot significantly different among the anaphylactic patients, asthmatic patients \non acute exacerbation and healthy subjects.

In addition, LTE4 concentration in patients \nwith anaphylactic shock is significantly elevated compared with that in patients \nwithout anaphylactic shock.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is a report on the significant increase in urinary LTE4 and \n9alpha, 11beta-PGF2 concentrations during anaphylaxis.

Biomarkers derive from a variety \nof sources [bronchiolar lavage (BAL), sputum, exhaled breath, and blood], and \nhave widely variant performance characteristics, and applicability.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Increasing attention is given to biomarkers in exhaled breath, \nboth gaseous (exhaled nitric oxide) and higher molecular weight moieties [in \nexhaled breath condensate (EBC)]. Current research in EBC analysis has focused \non validation, standardization, and technical considerations, whereas research \non exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) has moved to testing its predictive value in \nclinical situations. The use of advanced biostatistical techniques, and \ncombinatorial analyses has led to additional advances in the utility of \nbiomarkers.\nSUMMARY: To date, the best validated, and best performing biomarkers for \nclinical asthma appear to be measures of inflammation in induced sputum, and \nmeasures of ENO. Some trials using ENO appear particularly promising for early \nclinical use. EBC metrics are at present too inchoate for clinical purposes. \nHowever, not all important clinical and research questions can be addressed with \nsputum, EBC, or ENO metrics, leaving an important place for BAL, bronchial \nbiopsy, and perhaps EBC measurements in the research arena.",
