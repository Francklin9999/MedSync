Urinary LTE(4) levels were measured using ELISA and the airway  resistance Rint was assessed by the lung function instrument at the acute and  the convalescence phases. Twenty healthy children were used as the control  group. RESULTS: Urinary LTE(4) levels in asthmatic children at the acute and the  convalescence phases were significantly higher than those in the control group  (p<0.01). The urinary LTE(4) levels at the convalescence phase were  significantly reduced compared with those at the acute phase in asthmatic  children (p<0.01). More significantly decreased urinary LTE(4) levels were noted  in the montelukast treatment group than the conventional treatment group at the  convalescence phase (p<0.01). In the acute phase, there was no correlation  between urinary LTE4 level and Rint in asthmatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary LTE(4) level is significantly increased in children with  acute asthma. Urinary LTE(4) is a useful marker for the diagnosis of asthma and  can be as a predictor of asthma control and marker of susceptibility to  treatment with leukotriene receptor antagonists.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate  the acute effect of smoking in airway and systemic inflammation and oxidative  stress in normal smokers and patients with properly treated well-controlled  persistent asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten normal smokers and 10 smokers with moderate  persistent asthma controlled with LABA and ICS were recruited. Subjects  refrained from smoking for at least 12 h prior to their inclusion. We compared  the effects of smoking of two cigarettes on airway obstruction, airway  inflammation and oxidative stress [by measuring fraction of exhaled nitric oxide  (FeNO), plus pH and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC)] before and  30, 90 and 180 min after smoking. Furthermore, we evaluated systemic oxidative  stress, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) and urine leukotriene  E(4) (LTE(4)) before and 180 min after smoking. RESULTS: No differences were observed in EBC pH and 8-isoprostane, FeNO and  systemic oxidative stress between the groups at baseline. In asthmatics, EBC pH  decreased 30 min and EBC 8-isoprostane increased 90 min after smoking (P = 0.039  and P = 0.029 respectively), which was not evident in smoking controls. Serum  oxidative stress increased only in asthmatic smokers at 180 min (P = 0.001). No  differences were observed in SAA, CRP and urine LTE(4) levels before and after  smoking. CONCLUSION: Acute smoking has more deleterious effects in well-controlled  properly treated asthmatic smokers compared with matched normal smokers.",

However, the relationship  between asthma severity or eosinophilic inflammation and the concentrations of  mediators in sputum is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess sputum PGE(2), cysLT, 8-isoprostane and nitrate  concentrations, as well as urinary leukotriene (LT)E(4) and  9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin (PG)F(2) concentrations, in patients with differing  severities of asthma and eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic airway inflammation. METHODS: Inflammatory cells in sputum were assessed in 12 patients with mild, 14  with moderate and 12 with severe persistent asthma, as well as in 13 control  subjects. Asthmatic patients were categorized into those with eosinophilic or  non-eosinophilic airway inflammation. Sputum PGE(2), cysLT and 8-isoprostane,  and urinary LTE(4) were extracted on immunoaffinity sorbents, and the  concentrations of all mediators were measured using enzyme immunoassays. Sputum  nitrate concentrations were measured on a chemiluminescence analyzer. RESULTS: Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were higher in both moderate (1710 pg/mL)  and severe asthmatic (1590 pg/mL) compared with control subjects (827 pg/mL)  (P<0.05). CysLT concentrations were higher in moderate asthmatic compared with  control or severe asthmatic subjects (P<0.05). Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were  lower in patients with eosinophilic (1180 pg/mL) compared with non-eosinophilic  airway inflammation (2520 pg/mL) (P=0.02). In contrast, sputum cysLT and urinary  LTE(4) concentrations were higher in those with eosinophilic airway inflammation  (P<0.05). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s was inversely correlated with sputum  eosinophils in all asthmatic patients (r(s)=-0.5, P=0.002). There were no  significant differences in sputum 8-isoprostane or nitrate concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Increased airway concentrations of PGE(2) are consistent with the  hypothesis that PGE(2) has a bronchoprotective and anti-inflammatory role in  patients with more severe asthma. A reduced PGE(2) to cysLT ratio in the airways  may adversely affect lung function and contribute to persistence of symptoms and  airway remodelling in patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation.",

RESULTS: In the asthma model group, the total leucocytes, EOS and lymphocytes  were all increased, with significant differences as compared with the different  dosage Wuwei Dilong Decoction groups (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The serum LTB4 in  the asthma model group was significantly increased and IFN-gamma decreased.  After administration of Wuwei Dilong Decoction of the large, medium and small  dosages, LTB4 decreased, while IFN-gamma increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

        "background": "is not well correlated with objective evaluations of pulmonary function. A  medical food, EFF1009, containing the fatty acids gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreases leukotriene B(4) synthesis in patients  with asthma. Two previous clinical studies with EFF1009 provided preliminary  evidence that the medical food improves asthma-related quality of life (ARQOL)  and asthma management. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact on ARQOL of EFF1009 in adults with asthma. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a randomized, prospective,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in twenty-one (N = 21  evaluable) subjects with mild to moderate persistent asthma who consumed the  medical food emulsion or placebo emulsion daily for 28 days. All participants  continued their asthma medications throughout the study. ARQOL, including asthma  signs and symptoms, and asthma control were measured using the Mini Asthma  Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire  (ACQ), administered at baseline, Day 14 and Day 28. Safety and tolerability  parameters, including adverse events, were monitored. RESULTS: Baseline ARQOL scores, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))  and other characteristics were balanced between both groups. Mean (standard  error) total MiniAQLQ scores changed by 0.73 (0.38) and -0.22 (0.36) in the  EFF1009 and placebo groups, respectively, (p < 0.05). The MiniAQLQ symptom  domain score was improved in the EFF1009 group (p < 0.05). Total scores for the  ACQ were not significantly improved in either group. Levels of the fatty acid  EPA in plasma increased in the EFF1009 group but not the placebo group (p <  0.03). The medical food was well tolerated and no safety concerns were  identified. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary addition of the medical food EFF1009 to asthma  management regimens can improve patient perceived, ARQOL and can also improve  asthma management as evidenced by reduced asthma symptoms. An additional study  of the medical food, with larger subject population and longer treatment  duration, is warranted to confirm these findings.",

        "methods": "data from US commercial health plans, included patients with asthma aged 18  through 64 years who filled a prescription for at least 1 asthma controller  medication from September 1, 2003, through August 31, 2005. Outcome metrics  included the use of short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), the use of oral  corticosteroids, inpatient (INP)/emergency department (ED) visits, and  asthma-related health care costs. A subset of 5000 patients was randomly  selected for a survey using the Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, the  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, and the Asthma Therapy  Assessment Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 56,168 eligible patients, 823 returned completed questionnaires.  Compared with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), leukotriene modifiers (LMs) were  associated with lower odds of INP/ED visits (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; P<.001),  lower odds of using 6 or more SABA canisters (OR, 0.81; P<.001), and higher  annual cost ($193; P<.001). In the subgroup analysis of adherent patients, LMs  were associated with higher odds of INP/ED visits (OR, 1.74; P=.04), lower odds  of using 6 or more SABA canisters (OR, 0.46; P<.001), and higher annual cost  ($235; P<.001). Inhaled corticosteroids and LMs had a comparable impact on all  patient-reported outcomes. For combination therapy, ICS plus a long-acting  beta-agonist consistently showed at least equivalent or better outcomes in the  use of SABAs and oral corticosteroids, the risk of INP/ED visits, cost, asthma  control level, quality of life, and impairment in productivity and activity. CONCLUSION: Inhaled corticosteroids were associated with a lower risk of INP/ED  visits, and a lower cost if adherence was achieved. When adherence cannot be  achieved, LMs may be a reasonable alternative. Combination therapy with ICS plus  a long-acting beta-agonist was associated with better or equivalent clinical,  economic, and patient-reported outcomes.",

RESULTS: A total of twenty-five subjects with moderate and severe asthma were  enrolled. By combined therapy for one month the asthma symptoms relieved and  FEV(1)%pred improved significantly (P < 0.01). The concentrations of H(2)O(2),  NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) and LTE(4) in induced sputum and EBC declined significantly (P  < 0.01) although the concentrations were still higher than those at normal  baseline.

It was revealed that the concentrations of H(2)O(2)and  NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) but not of LTE(4) in EBC were negatively correlated with  FEV(1)%pred (P < 0.01) and positively with symptom scores.

The rats were sensitized with ovalbumin and AL (OH3), and  repeatedly exposed to aerosolized ovalbumin. Airway reactivity of the animals  were measured by animal lung function meter. VEGF levels and leukotriene D(4)  (LTD(4)) in serum were measured by enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The pathologic changes of bronchi and the lung tissue were evaluated, and the  expression of VEGF and its acceptors was analyzed with immunohistochemistry. The  vascular counts and vascular smooth muscle thickness were measured by using  image analysis system. RESULTS: The bronchial provocation test showed that, in the asthmatic group, the  average expiratory resistance increased remarkably. The serum levels of VEGF and  LTD(4) in the asthmatic group were 31 +/- 6 and 11 +/- 4 respectively,  significantly higher than those in the control group (17 +/- 5 and 6.1 +/- 0.7)  respectively and in the MK group (15 +/- 4 and 9.8 +/- 1.6) respectively.

The  level of LTC4S mRNA was expressed by the value of qCt, and the value of qCt was  diversely correlated with the level of LTC4S mRNA expression. The concentration  of urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) was measured using ELISA.

        "background": "other biologic fluids of patients with inflammatory, autoimmune, and allergic  diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate sPLA(2) activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid (BALF) of asthmatic patients and to examine the expression and release of  sPLA(2)s from primary human lung mast cells (HLMCs). METHODS: sPLA(2) activity was measured in BALF and supernatants of either  unstimulated or anti-IgE-activated HLMCs as hydrolysis of oleic acid from  radiolabeled Escherichia coli membranes. Expression of sPLA(2)s was examined by  using RT-PCR. The release of cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) C(4) was measured by  means of enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity was higher in the BALF of  asthmatic patients than in the control group. BALF PLA(2) activity was blocked  by the sPLA(2) inhibitors dithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by the cytosolic  PLA(2) inhibitor AZ-1. HLMCs spontaneously released a PLA(2) activity that was  increased on stimulation with anti-IgE. This PLA(2) activity was blocked by  dithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by AZ-1. HLMCs constitutively express mRNA  for group IB, IIA, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA, and XIIB sPLA(2)s. Anti-IgE  did not modify the expression of sPLA(2)s. The cell-impermeable inhibitor  Me-Indoxam significantly reduced (up to 40%) the production of LTC(4) from  anti-IgE-stimulated HLMCs. CONCLUSIONS: sPLA(2) activity is increased in the airways of asthmatic patients.  HLMCs express multiple sPLA(2)s and release 1 or more of them when activated by  anti-IgE. The sPLA(2)s released by mast cells contribute to LTC(4) production by  acting in an autocrine fashion. Mast cells can be a source of sPLA(2)s in the  airways of asthmatic patients.",
        "methods": "unstimulated or anti-IgE-activated HLMCs as hydrolysis of oleic acid from  radiolabeled Escherichia coli membranes. Expression of sPLA(2)s was examined by  using RT-PCR. The release of cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) C(4) was measured by  means of enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity was higher in the BALF of  asthmatic patients than in the control group. BALF PLA(2) activity was blocked  by the sPLA(2) inhibitors dithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by the cytosolic  PLA(2) inhibitor AZ-1. HLMCs spontaneously released a PLA(2) activity that was  increased on stimulation with anti-IgE. This PLA(2) activity was blocked by  dithiothreitol and Me-Indoxam but not by AZ-1. HLMCs constitutively express mRNA  for group IB, IIA, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA, and XIIB sPLA(2)s. Anti-IgE  did not modify the expression of sPLA(2)s. The cell-impermeable inhibitor  Me-Indoxam significantly reduced (up to 40%) the production of LTC(4) from  anti-IgE-stimulated HLMCs.

The  generation of superoxide anion (O2-), adhesion to the plates, and release of  eosinophil-derived neutrotoxin (EDN) were evaluated. RESULTS: Neither VCAM-1 nor LTD4 (100 nM) independently induced eosinophil O2-  generation, however, combined exposure to the two molecules synergistically  induced eosinophil O2- generation. ICAM-1 by itself induced eosinophil O2-  generation, which was enhanced by LTD4. On the contrary, P-selectin did not  induce O2- generation, either in the presence or absence of LTD4. LTD4  significantly enhanced eosinophil adhesion to rh-VCAM-1 and rh-ICAM-1, but not  to rh-P-selectin. Finally, we observed that combined exposure of eosinophils to  LTD4 and VCAM-1 induced the release of EDN. CONCLUSION: Combined exposure to VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 and cysLT effectively induces  the effector functions of eosinophils. Eosinophil adhesion to and migration  across endothelial cells via these specific adhesion proteins and subsequent  exposure to cysLTs may be mechanisms underlying activation of the effector  functions of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway.",

        "background": "inhalation challenge (SIC) with common allergens in patients with atopic asthma  has been shown previously, but there are scarce data with occupational agents.  We sought to determine whether there are differences in lower airway  inflammatory markers and the production of cytokines and eicosanoids between  patients with a positive or negative SIC response to occupational agents. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with suspected occupational asthma and 13 healthy  control subjects were studied. Spirometry, methacholine challenge, and sputum  induction were performed at baseline and 24 h after SIC with occupational  agents. Several cytokines and inflammatory mediators, including eicosanoids,  were measured in sputum. RESULTS: Twenty-six SICs were carried out with high-molecular-weight or  low-molecular-weight agents, and the responses were positive in 18 patients. SIC  elicited nine early asthmatic responses, two dual asthmatic responses, and seven  isolated late asthmatic responses. Significant increments in sputum eosinophil  counts were found only in patients with positive SIC responses compared with  baseline values. Interleukin-10 levels were decreased in patients with positive  and negative SIC responses compared to those in healthy control subjects. A  significant increase (p < 0.05) in the LTC(4)/prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) ratio  was observed in patients after positive SIC responses compared to those with  negative SIC responses. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of LTC(4), relative underproduction of PGE(2), and  greater airway eosinophilia were observed in patients with positive SIC  responses.",

        "background": "studies of subjects with well-characterized asthma are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI),  asthma impairment, and response to therapy. METHODS: BMI (in kilograms per meter squared) and asthma phenotypic and  treatment response data were extracted from Asthma Clinical Research Network  studies. The cross-sectional relationship between BMI and asthma impairment was  analyzed, as was the longitudinal relationship between BMI and response to  asthma controller therapies. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred sixty-five subjects with mild-to-moderate  persistent asthma were evaluated. Analyses of lean versus overweight/obese  asthmatic subjects demonstrated small differences in FEV1 (3.05 vs 2.91 L, P =  .001), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (mean, 83.5% vs 82.4%; P = .01), rescue  albuterol use (1.1 vs 1.2 puffs per day, P = .03), and asthma-related quality of  life (5.77 vs 5.59, P = .0004). Overweight/obese asthmatic subjects demonstrated  a smaller improvement in exhaled nitric oxide levels with inhaled corticosteroid  (ICS) treatment than did lean asthmatic subjects (3.6 vs 6.5 ppb, P = .04). With  ICS/long-acting beta-agonist treatment, overweight/obese asthmatic subjects  demonstrated smaller improvements in lung function than lean asthmatic subjects,  with an 80 mL (P = .04) and 1.7% (P = .02) lesser improvement in FEV1 and  FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio, respectively. Significant differences in  therapeutic response to leukotriene modifiers between BMI categories were not  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI is not associated with clinically significant  worsening of impairment in subjects with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma.  There is a modest association between increased BMI and reduced therapeutic  effect of ICS-containing regimens in this patient population. Prospective  studies evaluating the effect of being overweight or obese on treatment response  in asthma are warranted.",

        "background": "aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). However, a comprehensive  analysis of basophil responses to aspirin in terms of mediator release, cytokine  secretion and increased expression of surface activation markers has not been  performed. OBJECTIVE: To study the in vitro effects of aspirin on the concurrent release of  histamine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and IL-4 from human basophils and to also  evaluate changes in surface activation markers (CD63, CD69 and CD203c) expressed  by these cells. METHODS: Basophil-enriched cell suspensions from 10 patients with AERD and 10  healthy volunteers were incubated with lysine-aspirin for up to 3 h. Cells were  analysed for expression of CD63, CD69 and CD203c using flow cytometry. Cell-free  supernatants were evaluated for histamine, and LTC4 release and for IL-4  secretion. RESULTS: Aspirin-induced expression of CD63, CD69 and CD203c yielded 30%, 80%  and 70% sensitivity, respectively, but with poor specificity. There was no  significant difference in LTC4 synthesis between groups. None of the patients  with AERD (or controls) released IL-4 in response to aspirin. A higher dose of 5  mg/mL aspirin-mediated non-specific effects on basophils. CONCLUSION: Basophil responses to in vitro aspirin challenge are poor indicators  of clinical sensitivity. Aspirin activates some basophils by means of mechanisms  that differ from the classical IgE-mediated pathway. Our study also shows that  the use of 27 mm of aspirin (5 mg/mL) by previous investigators causes  non-specific basophil activation, thereby eliminating its usefulness in a  cell-based diagnostic test for AERD. Evaluation of in vitro basophil activation  has low clinical value in identifying aspirin-induced respiratory reactions.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the postseasonal increase in  the concentration of leukotriene (LT) B4 and LTE4 in exhaled breath condensate  (EBC) and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (BRM) in patients with  seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: In 28 patients with SAR and 50 healthy study patients, the leukotrienes  were measured in EBC during and after the pollen season by gas  chromatography/mass spectrometry. The BRM was determined after the pollen  season. RESULTS: In 7 patients with SAR, significantly increased concentrations of both  the leukotrienes were found in EBC during and 5 months after the pollen season.  The following seasonal and postseasonal median values were measured in patients  with SAR in comparison with control patients: LTB4: 131 and 90 pg/mL vs 80 and  79 pg/mL, P < .001 and P = .03, respectively; LTE4: 122 and 86 pg/mL vs 76 and  74 pg/mL, P < .001 and P = .02, respectively. Five months after the pollen  season, the concentrations of LTB4 and LTE4 decreased with respect to their  seasonal values (90 and 86 pg/mL, respectively, P < .001, for both  leukotrienes). In 7 patients with SAR and leukotriene levels exceeding the  reference limits, significantly increased BRM was also found (LTB4: P = .02;  LTE4: P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The seasonal and postseasonal increases in LTB4 and LTE4  concentrations in EBC of the patients with SAR correlated significantly with the  later increase in BMR. This relationship could provide a useful predictive  parameter for early inflammatory processes in the lower airways of patients with  allergic rhinitis.",

OBJECTIVE: We have investigated chemokine CC-ligand 5 (CCL5) production and its  association with eosinophil activation in the upper airways of aspirin-sensitive  patients both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Twenty aspirin-sensitive asthma/rhinosinusitis patients, 18  atopic-tolerant asthma/rhinosinusitis patients and 15 healthy control subjects  took part in the study. All subjects were challenged with saline and  lysine-acetylsalicylic acid (L-asa) on separate occasions. Nasal lavages were  obtained at baseline and 120 min after challenge and analysed for mediators'  release. RESULTS: When compared with control subjects, the baseline levels of CCL5 were  significantly increased in both sensitive and tolerant patients (there was no  significant difference in CCL5 concentrations between these two groups, P>0.05).  However, L-asa nasal challenge induced significantly increased levels of CCL5 in  the sensitive patients but not in the tolerant subjects (median: 380 vs. 140  pg/mL, P<0.0001). Similarly, the concentrations of both eosinophil cationic  protein (ECP) and cysteinil leukotriene (cys-LTs) were increased significantly  in the aspirin-sensitive but not in the tolerant patients. There was a trend  towards a significant correlation between CCL5 and ECP concentrations in the  sensitive patients following L-ASA challenge. On incubation with aspirin, nasal  tissue derived from aspirin-sensitive but not that derived from tolerant  subjects released increased CCL5 levels in culture. As determined by  immunohistochemistry, CCL5 was predominantly localized to the nasal airway  epithelium. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these findings suggest that CCL5 is released in  aspirin-sensitive asthma/rhinosinusitis.",

METHODS: Eighteen uncontrolled steroid-treated asthmatics, nine with and nine  without AR, were enrolled. Spirometry, peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements,  and exhaled breath condensate sampling were performed before and 8 weeks after  LM administration. The lowest PEF over the course of one week, expressed as a  percentage of the highest PEF (Min%Max PEF), was used as an index of fluctuation  of the airway caliber. Airway cytokine expression was analyzed with a protein  array. RESULTS: A significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second as  a percentage of the predicted value (%FEV(1)) and Min%Max PEF was seen in the  subgroup of asthma with AR. Although there was no significant difference in the  baseline cytokine values between the groups, the exhaled RANTES level was  significantly reduced by LM in the asthma with AR group. The changes in the  RANTES level were significantly related to the changes in the %FEV(1) and  Min%Max PEF values.

        "background": "considerable potential to maintain a microenvironment in the airway wall that  promotes airway inflammation and remodelling. Cysteinyl leucotrienes (CysLT) and  transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) are both increased in asthmatic  airways and may influence the pathophysiology of disease. However, the  consequences of activation of bronchial epithelial cells by these mediators are  not fully understood. A proteomic-based approach was used to characterize the  inflammatory pathways in bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with CysLT  and TGF-beta(1). METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were stimulated with 1 ng/mL  TGF-beta(1) and 50 nmol/L leucotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) for 48 h and whole-cell  lysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins showing  statistically significant differential expression were identified by  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and  database searching. RESULTS: Stimulation with LTE(4) increased the expression of three proteins and  five proteins showed decreased expression. Of the latter group, two were  definitively identified as heat shock protein (Hsp90 alpha) and stress-70  protein. Hsp90 alpha forms a heterocomplex with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)  and a significant decrease in GR following LTE(4) stimulation was confirmed.  TGF-beta(1) downregulated 18 intracellular proteins, including lamin A/C,  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, protein DJ-1, voltage-dependent  calcium channel gamma-7 subunit, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1  and stress-70 protein. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that by downregulating GR and Hsp90  alpha, CysLT may interfere with the action of glucocorticoids. Overall, the  results confirm the complex role of bronchial epithelium in aspects of airway  inflammation and remodelling.",

However, pathological evidence of the association between inflammatory mediators  and human anaphylaxis is insufficient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship  between in vivo production of inflammatory mediators and the pathogenesis of  anaphylaxis. We also sought to evaluate mast cell activation in anaphylaxis. METHODS: We measured the concentrations of various inflammatory mediators in  urine samples, which were collected from 32 anaphylactic patients during the  onset of anaphylaxis and during clinical remission, 21 patients with asthma on  acute exacerbation and 15 healthy control subjects. Blood and urine specimens  were collected from the patients after provocation test. Urinary leukotriene E4  (LTE4), 9alpha, 11beta-prostaglandin F2 (9alpha, 11beta-PGF2),  eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and leukotriene B4 glucuronide (LTBG)  concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay, and the activity of plasma  platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and serum tryptase concentration were  measured using commercially available kits. RESULTS: Significantly higher concentrations of urinary LTE4 and 9alpha,  11beta-PGF2, which immediately decreased during clinical remission, were  observed in the anaphylactic patients than in asthmatic patients on acute  exacerbation and healthy control subjects. Concentrations of EDN and LTBG were  not significantly different among the anaphylactic patients, asthmatic patients  on acute exacerbation and healthy subjects. There was a significant correlation  between urinary LTE4 and 9alpha, 11beta-PGF2 concentrations in the anaphylactic  patients (r=0.672, P=0.005, n=32). In addition, LTE4 concentration in patients  with anaphylactic shock is significantly elevated compared with that in patients  without anaphylactic shock. CONCLUSIONS: This is a report on the significant increase in urinary LTE4 and  9alpha, 11beta-PGF2 concentrations during anaphylaxis. Urinary LTE4 and 9alpha,  11beta-PGF2 concentrations may be a reliable marker of endogenous production of  inflammatory mediators associated with anaphylaxis.",

        "background": "Prostaglandin (PG)D2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLT) are important mediators  of asthmatic responses. To determine whether the sulphite additives in wine  alter the production of PGD2 and cysLT, asthmatic patients with compelling  histories of wine sensitivity were challenged with high- and low-sulphite wines;  the urinary metabolites of PGD2 and cysLT were measured before and after  challenge. METHODS: Eight self-reporting wine-sensitive asthmatic patients completed  double-blind challenges with high- and low-sulphite wines on separate days.  Urine samples were collected before and after consumption of 150 ml of wine.  Urinary concentrations of 9alpha,11beta-PGF2 and leukotriene (LT)E4 were  measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Urinary 9alpha,11beta-PGF2 concentrations increased in all subjects  following challenge with high-sulphite wine, and the median concentration  increased 1.6-fold (p < 0.01). Urinary 9alpha,11beta-PGF2 also increased  1.5-fold after low-sulphite wine challenge, although this did not reach  statistical significance (p = 0.08). The median difference in 9alpha,11beta-PGF2  concentration after high-sulphite wine challenge was not significantly different  compared with that after low-sulphite wine challenge. Median urinary LTE4  concentrations did not change significantly after either wine challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Increased urinary 9alpha,11beta-PGF2 concentrations following wine  challenge suggest mast cell activation as a possible mechanism for wine-induced  asthma, although this did not appear to be related to the sulphite additives in  wine. Urinary 9alpha,11beta-PGF2 may warrant further assessment as a potential  biomarker of reactivity to wine in asthmatic subjects.",

METHODS: The AMphi were obtained from twenty-one asthmatic adults using  fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Cells were pretreated with DMEM, pure EPA, an EPA-rich  media (45% EPA/10% DHA), pure DHA, a DHA-rich media (10% EPA/50% DHA) or  Lipovenos (n-6 PUFA), and then exposed to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium  (DMEM) (-) or LPS (+). Supernatants were analyzed for leukotriene (LT)B(4),  prostaglandin (PG)D(2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin  (IL)-1beta production. Detection of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression  levels was quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 120 microM pure EPA and EPA-rich media significantly (p<0.05)  suppressed TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression and the production of LTB(4),  PGD(2) and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in LPS-stimulated primary AMphi cells obtained  from asthmatic patients to a much greater extent than 120 microM pure DHA and  DHA-rich media respectively.

        "background": "the diagnosis of aspirin sensitivity, may be associated with severe adverse  reactions; thus, alternative procedures with a higher safety profile are highly  desirable. Although the cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) has been  proposed to be such an alternative, there is limited information about its  clinical usefulness. OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of our study to evaluate the clinical usefulness of  CAST in the diagnosis of aspirin sensitivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and/or nasal polyps  (n = 40), patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma and/or nasal polyps (n = 13) and  healthy volunteers (n = 26) were included. A 2-day, single-blind  placebo-controlled oral aspirin provocation test was performed. In vitro release  of cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) by peripheral blood leukocytes was measured  after stimulation with both stimulation buffer and lysine aspirin (2.5 mg/ml) by  CAST. RESULTS: Baseline Cys-LT levels were similar among the 3 groups. After lysine  aspirin stimulation, the net increase in Cys-LTs was significantly higher in  patients with aspirin sensitivity (median 91 pg/ml, interquartile range 22-206)  compared with aspirin-tolerant patients (20 pg/ml, range 0-46) and healthy  controls (23 pg/ml, range 0-71; p = 0.004). The assay had a sensitivity of 25%,  a specificity of 92.3%, and positive and negative predictive values of 28.7 and  90.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the leukocytes of patients with aspirin sensitivity produce  higher amounts of Cys-LTs as measured by CAST, the low sensitivity and  predictive values limit the clinical usefulness of this test in the diagnosis of  aspirin sensitivity.",

        "background": "polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on specific bronchial inflammation. Allergic  asthmatics were challenged using a low-dose allergen provocation model. METHODS: Our parallel double-blinded study randomly assigned 23 house dust  mite-allergic asthmatics (aged 22-29 years; 13 females, 10 males) to dietary  supplementation with either an n-3 PUFA-enriched fat blend (0.69 g/day) or  placebo for 5 weeks. After 3 weeks, the patients were challenged daily with low  doses of mite allergen for 2 weeks. Primary outcome parameters were effects on  lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV(1)) and exhaled nitric oxide  (eNO) as a marker of bronchial inflammation. RESULTS: Even before the bronchial challenge, eNO was significantly lower in the  n-3 PUFA group (p=0.014). Levels of eNO increased during allergen exposure in  both groups, but differences in means were significantly lower in the n-3 PUFA  group (p=0.022). During the low-dose allergen challenge, there were no  differences between the groups with regard to symptoms, FEV(1) or the allergen  dose required to induce deterioration of lung function (PD(20)).

        "background": "immunotherapy allowing safe administration of high allergen doses in a short  time interval compared to classic SIT. In the current study, we investigated the  safety profile and immunological effect of cluster SIT in children with allergic  asthma due to house dust mite allergy. METHODS: A total of 34 children (6-18 years) with allergic asthma were assigned  to cluster (n = 22) or classic SIT (n = 12). To achieve a maintenance dose of  allergen extract, cluster patients received 14 injections of house dust mite  allergen within 6 weeks, whereas the classic SIT group received 14 injections  within 14 weeks. Safety was monitored by recording adverse events.  Immunogenicity was measured by specific IgG(Mite) and IgG4(Mite), by  antibody-blocking properties on basophil activation, and by the T cell subset  transcription factors Foxp3, T-bet, and GATA-3. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in local and systemic side  effects between the two groups. In the cluster group, serum levels of specific  IgG(Mite) (p < 0.001) and specific IgG4(Mite) (p < 0.001) significantly  increased after 8 weeks, while it took 12 weeks in the classic SIT group. These  data were confirmed by blocking CD63 expression as well as release of cysteinyl  leukotrienes after in vitro basophil stimulation. No differences in  transcription factor expression were found in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Cluster SIT is safe in children. Additionally, our data demonstrated  an even more rapid induction of specific immune tolerance. Cluster SIT is an  attractive alternative to conventional up-dosing schedules with fewer  consultations for the patients.",
