Measurement of urinary leukotriene E(4) \n(LTE(4)) is a sensitive and noninvasive method of assaying total body CysLTs \nlevel. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of urinary \nleukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) in childhood asthma.\nMETHODS: Sixty children with acute asthma were randomly divided into montelukast \n(leukotriene receptor antagonist) treatment and conventional treatment groups (n \n= 30 each). Urinary LTE(4) levels were measured using ELISA and the airway \nresistance Rint was assessed by the lung function instrument at the acute and \nthe convalescence phases. Twenty healthy children were used as the control \ngroup.\nRESULTS: Urinary LTE(4) levels in asthmatic children at the acute and the \nconvalescence phases were significantly higher than those in the control group \n(p<0.01). The urinary LTE(4) levels at the convalescence phase were \nsignificantly reduced compared with those at the acute phase in asthmatic \nchildren (p<0.01). More significantly decreased urinary LTE(4) levels were noted \nin the montelukast treatment group than the conventional treatment group at the \nconvalescence phase (p<0.01). In the acute phase, there was no correlation \nbetween urinary LTE4 level and Rint in asthmatic children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Urinary LTE(4) level is significantly increased in children with \nacute asthma. Urinary LTE(4) is a useful marker for the diagnosis of asthma and \ncan be as a predictor of asthma control and marker of susceptibility to \ntreatment with leukotriene receptor antagonists.\n\n",

Although the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of statins \nis still unclear, an inhibition of protein prenylation by depleting the \ndownstream metabolites of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) \nreductase might be involved. To test the hypothesis, the effects of GGTI-2133, a \ndirect inhibitor of geran ylgeranyltransferase (GGTase), on antigen-induced \nairway inflammation were investigated in a murine model of allergic bronchial \nasthma. Mice were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with ovalbumin antigen \n(OA). Animals were also treated with GGTI-2133 (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) once a day \nbefore and during the antigen inhalation period. Repeated antigen inhalation \ncaused an infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, into \nairways. Significant increases in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, eotaxin, thymus and \nactivation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluids and total and OA-specific IgE in sera were also \nfound in the antigen-exposed animals. The systemic treatments with GGTI-2133 \ninhibited the antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into airways almost \ncompletely. However, interestingly, the GGTI-2133 treatment did not affect the \nlevels of these chemotactic factors and IgE.

It is a clinical syndrome \nassociated with chronic severe inflammation in the upper and lower airways \nresulting in chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, recurrent polyposis, and asthma. AERD \ngenerally develops secondary to abnormalities in inflammatory mediators and \narachidonic acid biosynthesis expression. Upper and lower airway eosinophil \ninfiltration is a key feature of AERD; however, the exact mechanisms of such \nchronic eosinophilic inflammation are not fully understood. Cysteinyl \nleukotriene over-production may be a key factor in the induction of eosinophilic \nactivation. Genetic studies have suggested a role for variability of genes in \ndisease susceptibility and response to medication. Potential genetic biomarkers \ncontributing to the AERD phenotype include HLA-DPB1*301, LTC4S, ALOX5, CYSLT, \nPGE2, TBXA2R, TBX21, MS4A2, IL10 -1082A > G, ACE -262A > T, and CRTH2 -466T > C; \nthe four-locus SNP set was composed of B2ADR 46A > G, CCR3 -520T > G, CysLTR1 \n-634C > T, and FCER1B -109T > C. Management of AERD is an important issue. \nAspirin ingestion may result in significant morbidity and mortality, and \npatients must be advised regarding aspirin risk. Leukotriene receptor \nantagonists (LTRA) that inhibit leukotriene pathways have an established role in \nlong-term AERD management and rhinosinusitis.

The \nbest-known mechanism of action of NSAIDs is the inhibition of prostaglandin \nsynthesis as a result of their action on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. However, \ndata have been accumulating through the years indicating that NSAIDs also act on \nother targets in cell signaling. It has been established that NSAIDs induce \nanti-inflammatory effects independent of COX. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nother inhibitors of COX induce severe bronchospasms and asthmatic attacks in a \nsignificant population of asthmatic patients. The etiology of ASA induced asthma \nis complex and not fully understood, but most evidence points towards an \nabnormality of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Since doses of ASA necessary to \ntreat chronic inflammatory diseases appeared much higher than those required to \ninhibit PG synthesis, COX-independent mechanisms of NSAIDs were postulated. \nRecently, we have shown that NSAIDs induced expression of heat shock proteins \nspecially HSP70. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are normal intracellular proteins \nthat are produced in greater amounts when cells are subjected to stress or \ninjury. Interestingly, a potential pathogenic role for heat shock proteins in \ndiseases such as autoimmune disease, vascular disease has been reported. Because \nmast cells have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of ASA induced \nasthma, a link between heat shock proteins and this disease could postulated. In \nthis review, an overview is given on aspirin-induced asthma and the cells and \nmediators that may play a role therein.

Despite the clinical significance of a \ndoctor's diagnosis of asthma in individuals with SCD, the criteria for a \nphysician diagnosis of asthma are not well defined. Many features of asthma are \ncommon in individuals with SCD, including symptoms of wheezing, obstructive lung \ndisease and airway hyper-responsiveness. However, it is not clear if these signs \nand symptoms of asthma reflect a physician diagnosis of asthma, or if these \nasthma features are related to SCD. Further complicating the diagnosis of asthma \nin children with SCD is the significant overlap in clinical manifestations \nbetween an asthma exacerbation and an ACS episode. Evidence supporting the \nconcept that asthma and SCD are separate co-morbid conditions includes a similar \nprevalence of asthma between children with SCD and those in the general \npopulation and the observation that asthma is inherited in a familial pattern in \nthe families of children with SCD. In contrast, there is significant evidence \nthat asthma-like features may be associated with SCD without a diagnosis of \nasthma, including a higher than expected prevalence of airway \nhyper-responsiveness and obstructive lung disease.

However, the relationship \nbetween asthma severity or eosinophilic inflammation and the concentrations of \nmediators in sputum is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess sputum PGE(2), cysLT, 8-isoprostane and nitrate \nconcentrations, as well as urinary leukotriene (LT)E(4) and \n9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin (PG)F(2) concentrations, in patients with differing \nseverities of asthma and eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic airway inflammation.\nMETHODS: Inflammatory cells in sputum were assessed in 12 patients with mild, 14 \nwith moderate and 12 with severe persistent asthma, as well as in 13 control \nsubjects. Asthmatic patients were categorized into those with eosinophilic or \nnon-eosinophilic airway inflammation.

Sputum \nnitrate concentrations were measured on a chemiluminescence analyzer.\nRESULTS: Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were higher in both moderate (1710 pg/mL) \nand severe asthmatic (1590 pg/mL) compared with control subjects (827 pg/mL) \n(P<0.05). CysLT concentrations were higher in moderate asthmatic compared with \ncontrol or severe asthmatic subjects (P<0.05). Sputum PGE(2) concentrations were \nlower in patients with eosinophilic (1180 pg/mL) compared with non-eosinophilic \nairway inflammation (2520 pg/mL) (P=0.02). In contrast, sputum cysLT and urinary \nLTE(4) concentrations were higher in those with eosinophilic airway inflammation \n(P<0.05). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s was inversely correlated with sputum \neosinophils in all asthmatic patients (r(s)=-0.5, P=0.002). There were no \nsignificant differences in sputum 8-isoprostane or nitrate concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased airway concentrations of PGE(2) are consistent with the \nhypothesis that PGE(2) has a bronchoprotective and anti-inflammatory role in \npatients with more severe asthma. A reduced PGE(2) to cysLT ratio in the airways \nmay adversely affect lung function and contribute to persistence of symptoms and \nairway remodelling in patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03386.x\n",

Only LTE(4) is \nsufficiently stable to be prominent in biologic fluids, such as urine or \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid, of asthmatic individuals and at sites of \ninflammation in animal models. LTE(4) has received little attention because it \nbinds poorly to the classical type 1 and 2 cysLT receptors and is much less \nactive on normal airways than LTC(4) or LTD(4). However, early studies indicated \nthat LTE(4) caused skin swelling in human subjects as potently as LTC(4) and \nLTD(4), that airways of asthmatic subjects (particularly those that were aspirin \nsensitive) were selectively hyperresponsive to LTE(4), and that a potential \ndistinct LTE(4) receptor was present in guinea pig trachea. Recent studies have \nbegun to uncover receptors selective for LTE(4): P2Y(12), an adenosine \ndiphosphate receptor, and CysLT(E)R, which was observed functionally in the skin \nof mice lacking the type 1 and 2 cysLT receptors.

Participation of circulating eosinophils in the airway \ninflammation in asthma involves their interaction with adhesion molecules \nexpressed on the endothelial cell surface and exposure to inflammatory \nmediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs).\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether interaction of eosinophils with adhesion \nmolecules modifies the functions of these cells induced by cysLTs.\nMETHODS: Eosinophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors, incubated \nin the EIA plates coated with adhesion proteins, and then exposed to LTD4. The \ngeneration of superoxide anion (O2-), adhesion to the plates, and release of \neosinophil-derived neutrotoxin (EDN) were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Neither VCAM-1 nor LTD4 (100 nM) independently induced eosinophil O2- \ngeneration, however, combined exposure to the two molecules synergistically \ninduced eosinophil O2- generation. ICAM-1 by itself induced eosinophil O2- \ngeneration, which was enhanced by LTD4. On the contrary, P-selectin did not \ninduce O2- generation, either in the presence or absence of LTD4. LTD4 \nsignificantly enhanced eosinophil adhesion to rh-VCAM-1 and rh-ICAM-1, but not \nto rh-P-selectin. Finally, we observed that combined exposure of eosinophils to \nLTD4 and VCAM-1 induced the release of EDN.\nCONCLUSION: Combined exposure to VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 and cysLT effectively induces \nthe effector functions of eosinophils. Eosinophil adhesion to and migration \nacross endothelial cells via these specific adhesion proteins and subsequent \nexposure to cysLTs may be mechanisms underlying activation of the effector \nfunctions of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway.\n\nCopyright 2009 S.

Aspirin activates some basophils by means of mechanisms \nthat differ from the classical IgE-mediated pathway.

Leukotrienes have been shown to mediate diverse \nfeatures of allergic conditions including inflammatory cell \nchemotaxis/activation and smooth muscle contraction. Cysteinyl leukotrienes \n(LTC(4), LTD(4) and, LTE(4)) and the dihydroxy leukotriene LTB(4) are generated \nby a series of enzymes/proteins constituting the LT synthetic pathway or \n5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. Their function is mediated by interacting with \nmultiple receptors. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and LT synthesis \ninhibitors (LTSI) have shown clinical efficacy in asthma and more recently in \nallergic rhinitis. Despite growing knowledge of leukotriene biology, the \nmolecular regulation of these inflammatory mediators remains to be fully \nunderstood. Genes encoding enzymes of the 5-LO pathway (i.e. ALOX5, LTC4S and \nLTA4H) and encoding for LT receptors (CYSLTR1/2 and LTB4R1/2) provide excellent \ncandidates for disease susceptibility and severity; however, their role remains \nunclear. Preliminary data also suggest that 5-LO pathway/receptor gene \npolymorphism can predict patient responses to LTSI and LTRA; however, the exact \nmechanisms require elucidation. The aim of this review was to summarize the \nrecent advances in the knowledge of these important mediators, focusing on \ngenetic and pharmacogenetic aspects in the context of allergic phenotypes.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02015.x\n",

New attention has been directed to the long-term \nchanges in asthmatic airways as indicated by the accelerated rate of lung \nfunction decline occurring in these patients despite therapy with inhaled \ncorticosteroids. These structural changes in the airway wall, termed airway \nremodeling, are now thought to be a key component in the pathophysiology of \nasthma. Airway remodeling is characterized by thickening of the lamina \nreticularis with deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins \nleading to subepithelial fibrosis and increased airway goblet cells causing \nmucus hypersecretion. Of note, there is myofibroblast proliferation and \nincreased airway smooth muscle mass caused by both hyperplasia and hypertrophy \nof smooth muscle cells. While an important role for cysteinyl leukotrienes \n(CysLTs) in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in \nasthma has been well-established, the specific role of CysLTs in airway \nremodeling is less clear. This aim of this review is to summarize the data from \nmouse models of asthma as well as limited human studies that demonstrate a key \nrole for CysLTs in allergen-induced mucus hypersecretion, thickening of the \nlamina reticularis, and subepithelial fibrosis in the lungs.

Cysteinyl leucotrienes (CysLT) and \ntransforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) are both increased in asthmatic \nairways and may influence the pathophysiology of disease. However, the \nconsequences of activation of bronchial epithelial cells by these mediators are \nnot fully understood. A proteomic-based approach was used to characterize the \ninflammatory pathways in bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with CysLT \nand TGF-beta(1).\nMETHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were stimulated with 1 ng/mL \nTGF-beta(1) and 50 nmol/L leucotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) for 48 h and whole-cell \nlysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Of the latter group, two were \ndefinitively identified as heat shock protein (Hsp90 alpha) and stress-70 \nprotein. Hsp90 alpha forms a heterocomplex with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) \nand a significant decrease in GR following LTE(4) stimulation was confirmed. \nTGF-beta(1) downregulated 18 intracellular proteins, including lamin A/C, \nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, protein DJ-1, voltage-dependent \ncalcium channel gamma-7 subunit, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 \nand stress-70 protein.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that by downregulating GR and Hsp90 \nalpha, CysLT may interfere with the action of glucocorticoids.

Up-regulation of kinin receptor expression in eosinophils of \nasthmatic patients may be a consequence of inflammation, whereby enhanced \nrelease of kinin peptides has a positive-feedback effect on kinin receptor \nexpression. Importantly, anti-inflammatory corticosteroids down-regulated the \nexpression of the kinin B(1)R.\n\nDOI: 10.1189/jlb.0508283\n",

Although the cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) has been \nproposed to be such an alternative, there is limited information about its \nclinical usefulness.\nOBJECTIVE: It was the aim of our study to evaluate the clinical usefulness of \nCAST in the diagnosis of aspirin sensitivity.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and/or nasal polyps \n(n = 40), patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma and/or nasal polyps (n = 13) and \nhealthy volunteers (n = 26) were included. A 2-day, single-blind \nplacebo-controlled oral aspirin provocation test was performed. In vitro release \nof cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) by peripheral blood leukocytes was measured \nafter stimulation with both stimulation buffer and lysine aspirin (2.5 mg/ml) by \nCAST.\nRESULTS: Baseline Cys-LT levels were similar among the 3 groups. After lysine \naspirin stimulation, the net increase in Cys-LTs was significantly higher in \npatients with aspirin sensitivity (median 91 pg/ml, interquartile range 22-206) \ncompared with aspirin-tolerant patients (20 pg/ml, range 0-46) and healthy \ncontrols (23 pg/ml, range 0-71; p = 0.004). The assay had a sensitivity of 25%, \na specificity of 92.3%, and positive and negative predictive values of 28.7 and \n90.7%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Although the leukocytes of patients with aspirin sensitivity produce \nhigher amounts of Cys-LTs as measured by CAST, the low sensitivity and \npredictive values limit the clinical usefulness of this test in the diagnosis of \naspirin sensitivity.\n\n2008 S.

Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, \nGermany.\n\nBACKGROUND: We investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of n-3 \npolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on specific bronchial inflammation. Allergic \nasthmatics were challenged using a low-dose allergen provocation model.\nMETHODS: Our parallel double-blinded study randomly assigned 23 house dust \nmite-allergic asthmatics (aged 22-29 years; 13 females, 10 males) to dietary \nsupplementation with either an n-3 PUFA-enriched fat blend (0.69 g/day) or \nplacebo for 5 weeks. After 3 weeks, the patients were challenged daily with low \ndoses of mite allergen for 2 weeks. Primary outcome parameters were effects on \nlung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV(1)) and exhaled nitric oxide \n(eNO) as a marker of bronchial inflammation.\nRESULTS: Even before the bronchial challenge, eNO was significantly lower in the \nn-3 PUFA group (p=0.014). Levels of eNO increased during allergen exposure in \nboth groups, but differences in means were significantly lower in the n-3 PUFA \ngroup (p=0.022). During the low-dose allergen challenge, there were no \ndifferences between the groups with regard to symptoms, FEV(1) or the allergen \ndose required to induce deterioration of lung function (PD(20)). Numbers of \nsputum eosinophils did not differ significantly, while serum eosinophils \n(10.1+/-0.1.84 vs. 5.79+/-0.69%) as well as changes in eosinophilic cationic \nprotein (20.5+/-9.93 vs. -1.68+/-4.36 ng/ml) and in vitro cysteinyl leukotriene \nrelease (2,889+/-872 vs. 1,120+/-173 ng/ml) were significantly lower in the n-3 \nPUFA group (p<0.05 each).\nCONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that dietary supplementation with n-3 \nPUFA is able to reduce bronchial inflammation even after low-dose allergen \nchallenge.\n\nCopyright 2008 S.

Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. ralf.schubert@kgu.de\n\nBACKGROUND: Cluster specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a modern form of allergen \nimmunotherapy allowing safe administration of high allergen doses in a short \ntime interval compared to classic SIT. In the current study, we investigated the \nsafety profile and immunological effect of cluster SIT in children with allergic \nasthma due to house dust mite allergy.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 children (6-18 years) with allergic asthma were assigned \nto cluster (n = 22) or classic SIT (n = 12). To achieve a maintenance dose of \nallergen extract, cluster patients received 14 injections of house dust mite \nallergen within 6 weeks, whereas the classic SIT group received 14 injections \nwithin 14 weeks. Safety was monitored by recording adverse events. \nImmunogenicity was measured by specific IgG(Mite) and IgG4(Mite), by \nantibody-blocking properties on basophil activation, and by the T cell subset \ntranscription factors Foxp3, T-bet, and GATA-3.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in local and systemic side \neffects between the two groups. In the cluster group, serum levels of specific \nIgG(Mite) (p < 0.001) and specific IgG4(Mite) (p < 0.001) significantly \nincreased after 8 weeks, while it took 12 weeks in the classic SIT group. These \ndata were confirmed by blocking CD63 expression as well as release of cysteinyl \nleukotrienes after in vitro basophil stimulation. No differences in \ntranscription factor expression were found in the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Cluster SIT is safe in children. Additionally, our data demonstrated \nan even more rapid induction of specific immune tolerance. Cluster SIT is an \nattractive alternative to conventional up-dosing schedules with fewer \nconsultations for the patients.\n\n(c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n\nDOI: 10.1159/000161585\n"
